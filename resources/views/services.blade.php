        <h2>Inter - Library Loan</h2>
        <div>

            This service may be used by faculty, post-graduate students, and undergraduate students and authorized
            research personnel of the University of Moratuwa. Requests for inter-library loan should be submitted to the
            Librarian through a letter by the Head of the Department or the course coordinator. Delivery time usually
            takes one day to two weeks depending on the location of the library where the item is been held. The loan
            period depends on the regulations of the library, which lends the material, but most libraries lend
            materials for two weeks from date the of issue.

            Although there is no charge for this service from the user the library spends a considerable amount of money
            for this service. Please check the UOM catalogue before submitting your requests for interlibrary loan.
            Contact the Issue Counter staff if you require this service.
